Head section cleanup and many usual custom settings used on every website setup as images settings and sizes, privacy, and basic admin customizations

== Description ==

WordPress Cleanup and Basic Options Functions is a utility plugin, even though it's was developed with a  focus on developers as many functionalities are what you might just add to every new website you build, it's really easy to use, just check the boxes corresponding to the set up you want.
It will help you:

*    Cleanup your website head and also some markup included with shortcodes section.
*    Prettify the search url, ex: http://yourwebsite.com/search/search-terms.
*    Load jQuery from Google CDN(default) or form your chosen cdn provider instead of using the hosted version.
*    Change the p to figure tag to surround your images.
*    Add Retina support for your images.
*    Add additional images sizes and modify those.
*    Setup a Logo and background color for your login page
*    Add some more privacy adding a "referrer" meta tag
*    If Yoast SEO is activated, can remove Yoast comments in head

And actually many other things.
Also besides the retina options(where you will be able to choose whether add the script from CDN or not), this plugin won't add any scritp or styles to your website frontend

Stay tuned as it will get updated possibly often with new features
